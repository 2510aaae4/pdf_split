# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop ZIP creation and download functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to zip all split PDF files and provide a download mechanism for the user.
# Details:
1. Create a function that:
   - Takes a list of split PDF file paths
   - Creates a ZIP file in a temporary location
   - Adds all split PDFs to the ZIP file with appropriate names
   - Returns the path to the created ZIP file
2. Implement '/download/<filename>' route using Flask's send_file
3. Modify the splitting process to trigger ZIP creation
4. Generate a unique filename for the ZIP file
5. Add appropriate headers for file download
6. Implement error handling for ZIP creation failures

# Test Strategy:
Test ZIP creation with various numbers and sizes of split PDFs. Verify all files are correctly included in the ZIP. Confirm download works correctly in different browsers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ZIP file generation function [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a utility function that takes a list of PDF file paths and creates a ZIP archive containing all files
### Details:
1. Create a new utility function `create_zip_from_pdfs(pdf_files)` that:
   - Takes a list of PDF file paths as input
   - Creates a temporary ZIP file using Python's zipfile module
   - Adds each PDF to the ZIP with appropriate naming
   - Handles file paths correctly, preserving only the filename in the ZIP
   - Returns the path to the created ZIP file
2. Generate a unique filename for the ZIP using timestamp and random string
3. Implement error handling for file access and ZIP creation failures
4. Add logging for debugging purposes

## 2. Implement download route in Flask [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a Flask route that allows users to download the generated ZIP file
### Details:
1. Implement a new route '/download/<filename>' in the Flask application
2. Use Flask's send_file function to serve the ZIP file
3. Set appropriate HTTP headers for file download:
   - Content-Type: application/zip
   - Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=...
4. Add error handling for cases where the requested file doesn't exist
5. Implement cleanup logic to remove temporary files after download

## 3. Integrate ZIP creation with PDF splitting workflow [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Modify the existing PDF splitting functionality to create a ZIP file and provide download link
### Details:
1. Update the PDF splitting route to call the ZIP creation function after all PDFs are generated
2. Store the ZIP file path in the session or a temporary database
3. Modify the frontend to display a download button/link after splitting is complete
4. Pass the ZIP filename to the frontend for constructing the download URL
5. Add appropriate error handling and user feedback
6. Ensure temporary files are managed properly (both split PDFs and ZIP file)
