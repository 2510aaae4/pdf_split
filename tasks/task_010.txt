# Task ID: 10
# Title: Perform integration testing and finalize MVP
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Integrate all components, perform end-to-end testing, and prepare the application for deployment.
# Details:
1. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete workflow:
   - File upload
   - Bookmark parsing and filtering
   - Bookmark selection
   - PDF splitting
   - ZIP creation and download
   - Temporary file cleanup
2. Test with various PDF types and sizes
3. Optimize performance where possible
4. Review code for security issues
5. Finalize documentation
6. Prepare deployment instructions
7. Create a requirements.txt file

# Test Strategy:
Conduct full end-to-end testing with various PDFs. Verify all components work together correctly. Test edge cases and error scenarios. Confirm resource usage is reasonable and performance is acceptable for the MVP.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing suite [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and execute a testing suite that validates the complete application workflow from file upload to ZIP download, with various PDF types and sizes.
### Details:
1. Create test cases covering the full workflow: file upload, bookmark parsing/filtering, bookmark selection, PDF splitting, ZIP creation/download, and temp file cleanup
2. Implement tests for edge cases: large PDFs (>100MB), PDFs with complex bookmark structures, PDFs with no bookmarks
3. Test with at least 5 different PDF types (academic papers, books, reports, etc.)
4. Document all test cases and results in a testing report
5. Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing

## 2. Optimize application performance and security [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Review and enhance the application's performance and security based on testing results, focusing on resource usage, response times, and potential vulnerabilities.
### Details:
1. Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks, especially in PDF processing and ZIP creation
2. Implement caching strategies where appropriate to improve response times
3. Optimize file handling to reduce memory usage during large file processing
4. Conduct a security review focusing on: file upload validation, temporary file handling, user input sanitization
5. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
6. Add proper error handling and logging throughout the application
7. Document all optimizations and security measures implemented

## 3. Prepare deployment package and documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Finalize all documentation and prepare the application for deployment with clear instructions and configuration files.
### Details:
1. Create a comprehensive requirements.txt file with all dependencies and version numbers
2. Write detailed deployment instructions for different environments (local, staging, production)
3. Document environment variables and configuration options
4. Create user documentation explaining how to use the application
5. Prepare developer documentation including architecture overview and API documentation
6. Create a README.md with quick start guide
7. Package the application for deployment (Docker container or deployment scripts)
8. Document any known limitations or future improvements
