# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop bookmark parsing functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core logic to extract and parse bookmarks from uploaded PDF files using PyPDF2.
# Details:
1. Create a utility function `get_bookmarks_recursive()` that:
   - Opens the PDF using PyPDF2.PdfReader
   - Recursively traverses the reader.outline structure
   - Extracts bookmark titles and corresponding page numbers using reader.get_destination_page_number()
   - Returns a structured list of bookmarks with titles and page numbers
2. Handle edge cases such as PDFs without bookmarks
3. Implement proper error handling for parsing failures
4. Add logging for debugging purposes

# Test Strategy:
Test with various PDFs containing different bookmark structures. Verify correct extraction of bookmark titles and page numbers. Confirm proper handling of PDFs without bookmarks or with corrupted bookmark structures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic bookmark extraction function [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core `get_bookmarks_recursive()` function that extracts bookmark information from PDF files
### Details:
1. Create a utility function `get_bookmarks_recursive()` that takes a PDF file path as input
2. Use PyPDF2.PdfReader to open the PDF file
3. Implement recursive traversal of the reader.outline structure
4. For each bookmark, extract title and page number using reader.get_destination_page_number()
5. Return a structured list/dictionary of bookmarks with their hierarchy preserved
6. Include basic validation to check if the file exists and is a valid PDF

## 2. Implement edge case handling [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Extend the bookmark extraction function to handle various edge cases and provide meaningful defaults
### Details:
1. Handle PDFs without bookmarks by returning an empty structure
2. Handle malformed bookmark structures that might cause traversal errors
3. Handle bookmarks that point to invalid page numbers
4. Add validation for empty or corrupted PDF files
5. Implement fallback behavior when bookmark extraction fails partially
6. Return appropriate status indicators along with the bookmark data

## 3. Add error handling and logging [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for the bookmark parsing functionality
### Details:
1. Implement try-except blocks around critical operations
2. Create specific exception types for different failure scenarios
3. Add detailed logging using Python's logging module
4. Log entry and exit points of the function
5. Log details about the PDF structure for debugging purposes
6. Include performance metrics in logs (time taken to parse)
7. Ensure errors are properly propagated with meaningful messages
8. Add documentation with examples of common error scenarios and how they're handled
